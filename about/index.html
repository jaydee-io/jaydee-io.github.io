    <div class="pb-3">Since I was young, I've always been fascinated by electronic and computer stuffs.
    And this have had a huge impact on my school cursus, which didn't stop oscillating
    between both themes. I started with a bachelor's degree in general electronics,
    then a degree in computer programming, next a master's degree in microelectronics,
    and finally an 'engineering-like' degree in software development.</div>

    <div class="pb-3">After trying a lot of programming langages (<code>Turbo Pascal</code>, <code>Basic</code>,
    <code>C</code>, <code>Cobol</code>, <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, ...), my
    taste definitively gone to close-to-hardware programming langage, <code>C</code>
    and <code>C++</code>. Few year after 2011 (arround 2013 I think), I
    discovered that the C++ ISO comitee updated the langage to a wonderfull
    brand new stuff: what we now call <code>Modern C++</code>.</div>
